## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run Knowledge Navigator on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10 or higher installed.
* A Google Gemini API Key. Get yours from [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/sathish-02/Knowledge-Navigator-App.git](https://github.com/sathish-02/Knowledge-Navigator-App.git)
    cd Knowledge-Navigator-App
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    * On Windows:
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv  # Use python3 if `python` points to an older version
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Set up your Google Gemini API Key:**
    * Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project directory.
    * Add your API key to this file:
        ```
        GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-google-gemini-api-key-here"
        ```
        **Remember to replace `"your-google-gemini-api-key-here"` with your actual key.**
        **DO NOT commit your `.env` file to public repositories!** (It's already in `.gitignore`).

5.  **Run the Streamlit application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    The app will open in your default web browser, usually at `http://localhost:8501`.

## üåê Deployment (Streamlit Community Cloud)

This application is designed for easy deployment on Streamlit Community Cloud:

1.  Ensure your code is pushed to a public GitHub repository (which you've already done!).
2.  Go to [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://share.streamlit.io/) and log in with your GitHub account.
3.  Click "New app" and select your `sathish-02/Knowledge-Navigator-App` repository, `main` branch, and `app.py` as the main file.
4.  In "Advanced settings" -> "Secrets", add your API key:
    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY = "your-google-gemini-api-key-here"
    ```
    (Use the same exact key you used in your `.env` file).
5.  Click "Deploy!".
